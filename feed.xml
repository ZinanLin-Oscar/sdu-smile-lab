The research, published in <em>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</em>, demonstrates how highly interconnected supply chains exhibit a <strong>“robust yet fragile” paradox</strong>—resilient to random shocks but vulnerable to targeted disruptions.</p>

<h2 id="the-lithium-challenge">The Lithium Challenge</h2>
<p>Lithium is essential for <strong>electric vehicle batteries</strong> and the <strong>global energy transition</strong>. However, the <strong>geographical mismatch</strong> between production and consumption regions, combined with <strong>highly concentrated supply sources</strong> and <strong>complex global trade networks</strong>, exposes the supply chain to unprecedented risks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trade restrictions</li>
  <li>Resource nationalism</li>
  <li>Natural disasters</li>
  <li>Geopolitical conflicts</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="innovative-methodology">Innovative Methodology</h2>

<p>The research breaks new ground by combining:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Trade-linked material flow analysis</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Multi-layer network modeling</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This created a comprehensive map of the global lithium supply chain across <strong>six life cycle stages</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ore</li>
  <li>Basic chemicals</li>
  <li>Chemical derivatives</li>
  <li>Final products</li>
  <li>Use</li>
  <li>Recycling</li>
</ol>

<p>The team extended traditional static network metrics (e.g. <strong>degree centrality</strong>, <strong>closeness centrality</strong>, <strong>betweenness centrality</strong>, <strong>eigenvector centrality</strong>, <strong>PageRank</strong>, and <strong>Laplacian centrality</strong>) to multi-layer networks, and adapted <strong>dynamic cascading failure models</strong> to directed, weighted multi-layer networks.</p>

<h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2>

<h3 id="highly-interconnected-but-geographically-concentrated">Highly Interconnected but Geographically Concentrated</h3>

<p>In <strong>2022</strong>, the lithium supply chain multi-layer network comprised:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>865 nodes</strong> across <strong>225 countries</strong> and <strong>6 life cycle stages</strong></li>
  <li><strong>14,362 intra-layer links</strong> (trade relationships)</li>
  <li><strong>634 inter-layer links</strong> (production, processing, and consumption relationships)</li>
</ul>

<p>Critical statistics include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>45%</strong> of global lithium ore (<strong>83 kt</strong> out of <strong>183 kt</strong>) enters international trade, with <strong>Australia-to-China</strong> flows dominating at <strong>79 kt</strong></li>
  <li><strong>55%</strong> of basic lithium chemicals (<strong>119 kt</strong> out of <strong>218 kt</strong>) are traded internationally
    <ul>
      <li>Major exporters: <strong>Chile, Argentina, Netherlands, China</strong></li>
      <li>Major importers: <strong>South Korea, Japan, US</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>China</strong> exports approximately <strong>30 kt</strong> of chemical derivatives and <strong>10 kt</strong> of final products</li>
</ul>

<p>Key players: <strong>Australia, China, Chile, Japan, South Korea, US, EU</strong> — creating both <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>vulnerability</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="robust-yet-fragile-network-characteristics">“Robust Yet Fragile” Network Characteristics</h3>

<p>The study identified different node types based on their roles in <strong>risk propagation</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk Propagation Hubs</strong> (high degree centrality): Absorb random shocks but amplify targeted disruptions</li>
  <li><strong>Risk Amplifiers</strong> (high closeness centrality): Spread local disturbances via shortest paths</li>
  <li><strong>Risk Bridges</strong> (high betweenness centrality): Connect suppliers and consumers; disruption can fragment the network</li>
  <li><strong>Network Stabilizers</strong> (high Laplacian centrality): Maintain overall connectivity</li>
  <li><strong>Influential Risk Propagators</strong> (high eigenvector/PageRank): Highly connected with significant destructive potential</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="china-us-decoupling-scenarios">China-US Decoupling Scenarios</h2>

<p>The study simulated various degrees of <strong>China-US supply chain decoupling</strong>, revealing systemic implications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Direct Impact</strong>:<br />
China-US lithium trade = only <strong>3%</strong> of global trade volume → even <strong>100% decoupling</strong> does <strong>not</strong> improve US systemic risk position.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Indirect Impact</strong>:<br />
Cascading effects are substantial:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>In <strong>100% decoupling</strong> scenarios:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>61 countries</strong> see increased dynamic criticality (<strong>7%</strong> of global total)</li>
          <li><strong>73 countries</strong> experience increased dynamic vulnerability (<strong>7%</strong> increase)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Germany, Poland, Hungary</strong> gain criticality at the expense of <strong>India, Vietnam, Australia</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Chile, India, Canada</strong> reduce vulnerability; <strong>Malawi, Mexico, Slovakia, Ukraine</strong> increase</li>
      <li>Most decoupling scenarios (<strong>50–100%</strong>) increase global systemic risk by ~<strong>5%</strong></li>
      <li>However, <strong>25% decoupling</strong> could reduce global dynamic vulnerability by <strong>8.26%</strong>, with only marginal increase in criticality → suggesting <strong>partial decoupling</strong> may balance efficiency and security</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="policy-implications">Policy Implications</h2>

<p>The research calls for <strong>global cooperation</strong> to avoid <strong>“zero-sum games”</strong> in securing lithium supply chains. As geopolitical tensions intensify and supply chains shift from <strong>global integration</strong> toward <strong>diversified confrontation</strong>, policymakers must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move beyond simple diversification</li>
  <li>Optimize <strong>network topology</strong> to balance <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>security</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Countries with high vulnerability need:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Internal optimization</strong> to improve self-sufficiency</li>
  <li><strong>External cooperation</strong> to integrate domestic industries into regional/global supply chains<br />
→ Enhancing <strong>competitive position</strong> and <strong>bargaining power</strong></li>
</ul>

The research, recently accepted by <em>Nature Communications</em>, quantifies for the first time the complete “hidden flows”—mining waste including overburden, waste rock, and tailings—along China’s passenger car supply chain.</p>

<h2 id="alarming-findings">Alarming Findings</h2>
<p>Using <strong>China</strong> as a case study (the world’s largest NEV producer and consumer), the international research team led by <strong>Professor Kazuyo Matsubae</strong> (Tohoku University) and <strong>Professor Gang Liu</strong> (Peking University) found:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>new energy vehicle (NEV)</strong> generates <strong>over 3 times</strong> the hidden flows of a conventional vehicle.</li>
  <li><strong>Hidden flows exceed eventual used resources by 35 times</strong>, with only <strong>3%</strong> of extracted materials entering the car sector.</li>
  <li><strong>1,163 million tons</strong> of materials were extracted to produce China’s passenger cars in <strong>2019</strong>, generating <strong>1,106 Mt</strong> of mining waste.</li>
  <li><strong>48%</strong> of these hidden flows occur <strong>outside China</strong>, primarily in <strong>Chile, Australia, Peru, and South Africa</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="innovative-methodology">Innovative Methodology</h2>

<p>The study developed a <strong>global mine-site-specific database</strong> covering <strong>1,784 mines</strong> across <strong>11 metal minerals</strong>, and created a <strong>life-cycle-based Total Material Requirement (TMR) framework</strong>.</p>

<p>This high-resolution approach reveals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Critical battery materials—<strong>lithium, cobalt, and nickel</strong>—though comprising only <strong>0.4–9.5%</strong> of direct material flows, contribute <strong>6–41%</strong> of hidden flows per vehicle.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="path-forward">Path Forward</h2>

<p>The research identifies <strong>concrete mitigation strategies</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Recycling copper</strong> (which contributes <strong>37%</strong> of hidden flows) could reduce total waste by <strong>35%</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Switching from NMC/NCA batteries to LFP batteries</strong> could achieve <strong>3–12%</strong> reduction.</li>
  <li><strong>Clean energy transition</strong> in smelting and refining could reduce hidden flows by <strong>13–14%</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“About half of these hidden flows occur abroad, revealing an unequal distribution of environmental burdens,” notes the research team.<br />
“Achieving a sustainable e-mobility transition requires coordinated international cooperation along the entire supply chain—from mining countries improving extraction practices to manufacturing countries adopting responsible sourcing and efficient product designs.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The findings underscore the need to <strong>balance greenhouse gas reduction goals with broader environmental sustainability</strong>, ensuring that the transition to electric mobility doesn’t simply <strong>shift environmental problems from emissions to mining waste</strong>.</p>

The research, published in <em>Scientific Data</em> (Nature), provides the first comprehensive view of <strong>steel, aluminum, and cement stocks</strong> worldwide at a <strong>500×500-meter grid resolution</strong> from <strong>2000 to 2019</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="a-new-window-into-urban-material-accumulation">A New Window into Urban Material Accumulation</h2>

<p>The SDU team—including <strong>Associate Professor Wu Chen</strong>, <strong>Dr. Kun Sun</strong> from the Department of Green Technology—collaborated with <strong>Professor Bailang Yu</strong> (East China Normal University) and <strong>Professor Gang Liu</strong> (Peking University) to create this high-resolution dataset.</p>

<p>The work integrates <strong>reconciled nighttime light imagery</strong> with <strong>national material stock data</strong>, overcoming critical limitations in previous satellite-based approaches.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Traditional approaches faced a trade-off between research scope and spatial resolution,” explains the research team.<br />
“Our dataset bridges this gap by combining top-down material flow analysis with advanced nighttime light data processing.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="key-innovation">Key Innovation</h2>

<p>The dataset addresses two major challenges in previous global material stock maps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enhanced resolution</strong>:<br />
Improves from <strong>1km</strong> to <strong>500m</strong> grid resolution, revealing finer spatial details within cities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Improved accuracy</strong>:<br />
Mitigates <strong>saturation</strong> and <strong>blooming effects</strong> in nighttime light data that compromised earlier estimates.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The methodology employs <strong>country-specific regression models</strong> that establish relationships between average material stocks and light intensity per unit area, accounting for distinct developmental patterns across <strong>119 nations</strong> with known stock data.</p>

<h2 id="global-implications">Global Implications</h2>

<p>The comprehensive dataset comprises <strong>60 TIFF files</strong> documenting <strong>three key construction materials</strong> over <strong>two decades</strong>.</p>

<p>Validation studies demonstrate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Over <strong>80%</strong> of city-level estimates fall within <strong>–20% to +40%</strong> of literature-reported values.</li>
  <li>Reasonable consistency despite geographic variations.</li>
</ul>

<p>The research reveals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Global anthropogenic stocks continue to <strong>accumulate</strong>, with significant <strong>spatial heterogeneity</strong> between and within urban areas.</li>
  <li><strong>Urban core areas</strong> show higher stock densities previously obscured by satellite data limitations.</li>
  <li>Distribution patterns highlight <strong>disparities in material accumulation</strong> across different development stages.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="applications-for-sustainability">Applications for Sustainability</h2>

<p>This spatially explicit dataset serves as an essential resource for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Urban mining</strong>: Identifying recyclable material reservoirs for circular economy strategies.</li>
  <li><strong>Climate action</strong>: Carbon accounting and decarbonization planning through embodied emissions assessment.</li>
  <li><strong>Urban planning</strong>: Supporting strategic infrastructure development and waste management policies.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy development</strong>: Enabling sub-city level analysis crucial for localized sustainability initiatives.</li>

The research, published in <em>Resources, Conservation and Recycling</em>, tracks <strong>five decades</strong> of sand and gravel stocks and flows across <strong>184 countries</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2>

<p>The study challenges common assumptions about construction materials:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Global <strong>gravel extraction</strong> is <strong>twice</strong> that of sand:<br />
<strong>22.1 billion tons</strong> vs. <strong>10.3 billion tons</strong> in <strong>2019</strong>.</li>
  <li>Yet <strong>sand dominates international trade</strong>, at <strong>1.9 times</strong> the volume of gravel.</li>
  <li>This discrepancy highlights <strong>greater trade dependency</strong> and <strong>supply vulnerability</strong> for sand resources.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters</h2>

<p>While sand and gravel are often studied together, this research demonstrates the importance of distinguishing between them:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sand</strong> (particles &lt;2mm) and <strong>gravel</strong> (larger particles) serve <strong>different functions</strong> in construction.</li>
  <li>They have <strong>distinct life cycle behaviors</strong> and face <strong>different supply challenges</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The study found:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Asia</strong> accounts for <strong>54.6%</strong> of global sand stocks, driven by rapid urbanization.</li>
  <li><strong>Singapore</strong> remains the <strong>world’s largest sand importer</strong>, making it particularly vulnerable to trade disruptions.</li>
  <li><strong>Per capita sand consumption</strong> continues to rise globally.</li>
  <li><strong>Gravel stocks</strong> in industrialized regions show signs of <strong>saturation</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="implications-for-sustainability">Implications for Sustainability</h2>

<p>The findings underscore the urgent need for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improved <strong>recycling technologies</strong></li>
  <li>Policy support for <strong>artificial aggregates</strong></li>
  <li>Better <strong>resource management strategies</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>As developing regions in <strong>Africa</strong>, <strong>South America</strong>, and <strong>Southeast Asia</strong> continue urbanizing, demand for these materials will surge—intensifying the risk of <strong>resource depletion</strong> and <strong>environmental damage</strong>.</p>

<p>The research was supported by multiple funding sources, including the <strong>Independent Research Fund Denmark (iBuildGreen project)</strong>, highlighting the <strong>international collaboration</strong> essential to addressing global resource challenges.<br />
