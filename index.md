# **About US**

We are a research group in the [Department of Green Technology](https://www.sdu.dk/en/igt) at the Faculty of Engineering, [University of Southern Denmark](https://www.sdu.dk/en). 

Our work focuses on the sociometabolic dynamics of contemporary societies. We analyze material and energy flows to understand systemic patterns, technological transitions, and sustainability implications.

Research Themes:
- **Metabolic patterns and drivers of different societal systems**
- **Sustainability implications of sociometabolic transitions**
- **Spatially and technologically refined stocks and flows analysis**
