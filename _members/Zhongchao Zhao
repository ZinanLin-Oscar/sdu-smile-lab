Zhongchao is a Postdoc in Life Cycle Engineering at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). His research centers on the Material-Energy-Economy (MEE) nexus, with a focus on advancing pathways toward sustainable development and circular economy transitions. His research interests encompass material circularity, supply chain optimization, corporate finance, and sustainable investment. He is proficient in combining digital technologies (e.g., big data, machine learning, text analysis, and remote sensing) with multidisciplinary knowledge (e.g., material flow analysis, input-output analysis, complex network analysis, critical assessment, and life cycle assessment) to model and simulate the social metabolism of critical raw materials, supporting the transitions toward green and digital economies. Zhongchao obtained his doctoral degree from the Ocean University of China. His interdisciplinary background in Economics and Management Science provides unique perspectives on the socio-economic dimensions of sustainability and resource governance.
