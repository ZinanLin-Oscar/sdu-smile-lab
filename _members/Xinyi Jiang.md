Xinyi Jiang is a PhD Student at the Department of Green Technology (IGT), Faculty of Engineering, University of Southern Denmark. Xinyi Jiang‘s research focuses on understanding how material flows and market dynamics influence the value of demounted building materials, particularly in the context of circular economy strategies. With an MSc in Digital Innovation in Built Asset Management from UCL’s Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction, Xinyi specializes in point cloud data processing and spatial database management. Her technical expertise was honed through urban renewal initiatives, where she integrated IoT, AR, and 3D geometric algorithms for environmental modeling. Prior to commencing her doctoral studies, she served as a Research Assistant at Tongji University’s Shanghai Key Laboratory of Urban Renewal and Spatial Optimization Technology. There, she pioneered analyses of multimodal urban datasets — synthesizing GIS, BIM, satellite imagery, and planning databases — to enable high-resolution built environment characterization. As part of the QuiVal project, Xinyi’s research focuses on economic valuation dynamics of deconstructed materials (notably steel and timber), evaluating factors like scrap availability, reuse adaptability, and market fluctuations. By incorporating quantum-inspired computational approaches, she aims to model complex market interdependencies and uncertainties, ultimately developing a comprehensive framework for sustainable material recovery.
