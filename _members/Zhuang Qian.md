Zhuang Qian is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU) with a PhD from the University of Bologna. His work advances food system sustainability through two major strands: Material Flow Analysis for supply chain mapping and behavioural economics for intervention design and evaluation. His research covers food loss and waste quantification and data analysis; consumer behaviour change to reduce waste; and emission accounting, efficiency assessment, and mitigation strategies for livestock supply chains. He contributes to the Horizon Europe project WASTELESS and SDU’s Fast-Track initiative (Pig-Green), creating high-resolution datasets and practical tools to cut environmental impacts across the food system.
