Associate Professor Wu Chen from the University of Southern Denmark (SDU) has co-authored a groundbreaking study revealing that the global shift to electric vehicles generates far more mining waste than previously understood. The research, recently accepted by Nature Communications, quantifies for the first time the complete "hidden flows"—mining waste including overburden, waste rock, and tailings—along China's passenger car supply chain.
