On May 8th, the research team from the University of Southern Denmark (SDU)—Morten Birkved, Wu Chen, Xinyi Jiang, Antonia Klipp, and Zinan Lin—held their first in-person meeting with industry partners Lene Brix from Circue and Pernille Krohn Ohms from Rambøll in Copenhagen.

The meeting opened with an introduction to the QuiVal project, outlining its goals and relevance in promoting sustainable practices within the built environment. Three PhD candidates then took the stage to showcase their research plans, presenting collaborative proposals aimed at enhancing the project. They also discussed the challenges they have encountered in their research and the types of partnerships they seek from the industry. Their insights emphasized the importance of industry collaboration in advancing circular economy principles.

Lene provided an overview of Circue’s mission, which focuses on creating a digital platform that ensures the quality and value of building stock through data-driven analysis and insights. This platform helps building owners optimize their assets and make informed decisions about maintenance and improvements. Pernille shared valuable insights into Rambøll’s experiences, highlighting an increasing client interest in reusing materials and components. She noted that there is significant room for improvement in business models and the need to enhance stakeholder awareness regarding sustainability demands.
 
The meeting established a strong foundation for what is expected to be a productive collaboration. The discussions enhanced the understanding of each party's objectives and strengths, setting the stage for effective cooperation. We look forward to three years of shared learning and impactful results.
