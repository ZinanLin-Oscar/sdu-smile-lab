**SMILE LAB** has led the development of a groundbreaking **global dataset** that maps **anthropogenic material stocks** at unprecedented resolution. The research, published in *Scientific Data* (Nature), provides the first comprehensive view of **steel, aluminum, and cement stocks** worldwide at a **500×500-meter grid resolution** from **2000 to 2019**.

## A New Window into Urban Material Accumulation

The SDU team—including **Associate Professor Wu Chen**, **Dr. Kun Sun** from the Department of Green Technology—collaborated with **Professor Bailang Yu** (East China Normal University) and **Professor Gang Liu** (Peking University) to create this high-resolution dataset.

The work integrates **reconciled nighttime light imagery** with **national material stock data**, overcoming critical limitations in previous satellite-based approaches.

> “Traditional approaches faced a trade-off between research scope and spatial resolution,” explains the research team.  
> “Our dataset bridges this gap by combining top-down material flow analysis with advanced nighttime light data processing.”

## Key Innovation

The dataset addresses two major challenges in previous global material stock maps:

- **Enhanced resolution**:  
  Improves from **1km** to **500m** grid resolution, revealing finer spatial details within cities.

- **Improved accuracy**:  
  Mitigates **saturation** and **blooming effects** in nighttime light data that compromised earlier estimates.

The methodology employs **country-specific regression models** that establish relationships between average material stocks and light intensity per unit area, accounting for distinct developmental patterns across **119 nations** with known stock data.

## Global Implications

The comprehensive dataset comprises **60 TIFF files** documenting **three key construction materials** over **two decades**.

Validation studies demonstrate:

- Over **80%** of city-level estimates fall within **–20% to +40%** of literature-reported values.
- Reasonable consistency despite geographic variations.

The research reveals:

- Global anthropogenic stocks continue to **accumulate**, with significant **spatial heterogeneity** between and within urban areas.
- **Urban core areas** show higher stock densities previously obscured by satellite data limitations.
- Distribution patterns highlight **disparities in material accumulation** across different development stages.

## Applications for Sustainability

This spatially explicit dataset serves as an essential resource for:

- **Urban mining**: Identifying recyclable material reservoirs for circular economy strategies.
- **Climate action**: Carbon accounting and decarbonization planning through embodied emissions assessment.
- **Urban planning**: Supporting strategic infrastructure development and waste management policies.
- **Policy development**: Enabling sub-city level analysis crucial for localized sustainability initiatives.

The dataset is supported by the **Independent Research Fund Denmark (iBuildGreen project)** and **China's National Natural Science Foundation**, highlighting strong **international collaboration** in addressing global resource challenges.

**Scientific Data** is a peer-reviewed, open-access journal for descriptions of datasets published by **Nature Portfolio**.  
The dataset will be **maintained and updated every 3–5 years** to ensure continued relevance for global sustainability research.
