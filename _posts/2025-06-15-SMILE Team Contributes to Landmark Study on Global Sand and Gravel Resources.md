**SMILE Team** has co-authored a groundbreaking study that reveals critical insights into the **global sand and gravel crisis**. The research, published in *Resources, Conservation and Recycling*, tracks **five decades** of sand and gravel stocks and flows across **184 countries**.

## Key Findings

The study challenges common assumptions about construction materials:

- Global **gravel extraction** is **twice** that of sand:  
  **22.1 billion tons** vs. **10.3 billion tons** in **2019**.
- Yet **sand dominates international trade**, at **1.9 times** the volume of gravel.
- This discrepancy highlights **greater trade dependency** and **supply vulnerability** for sand resources.

## Why It Matters

While sand and gravel are often studied together, this research demonstrates the importance of distinguishing between them:

- **Sand** (particles <2mm) and **gravel** (larger particles) serve **different functions** in construction.
- They have **distinct life cycle behaviors** and face **different supply challenges**.

The study found:

- **Asia** accounts for **54.6%** of global sand stocks, driven by rapid urbanization.
- **Singapore** remains the **world's largest sand importer**, making it particularly vulnerable to trade disruptions.
- **Per capita sand consumption** continues to rise globally.
- **Gravel stocks** in industrialized regions show signs of **saturation**.

## Implications for Sustainability

The findings underscore the urgent need for:

- Improved **recycling technologies**
- Policy support for **artificial aggregates**
- Better **resource management strategies**

As developing regions in **Africa**, **South America**, and **Southeast Asia** continue urbanizing, demand for these materials will surge—intensifying the risk of **resource depletion** and **environmental damage**.

The research was supported by multiple funding sources, including the **Independent Research Fund Denmark (iBuildGreen project)**, highlighting the **international collaboration** essential to addressing global resource challenges.
