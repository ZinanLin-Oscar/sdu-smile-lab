Despite their global reputation for environmental leadership, **Nordic countries face significant challenges in plastic waste management**, according to a new study co-led by **Associate Professor Wu Chen** from the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). The research, published in *ACS Sustainable Resource Management*, provides the first comprehensive, polymer-level analysis of plastic flows across all five Nordic nations.

## Surprising Findings

The study reveals a stark contrast between the Nordic region's environmental ambitions and its plastic recycling reality:

- Less than **6%** of plastic waste is actually recycled.
- Over **70%** of plastic waste is **incinerated**, despite strong sustainability policies.

## Key Insights

Using **dynamic material flow analysis**, the team tracked **14 polymer groups** across **Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Iceland** from **1978 to 2020**, analyzing over **5.4 million trade records**:

- Nordic countries have the **world's highest per capita plastic stocks** at **1,100 kg per person** in 2020, reaching saturation levels.
- **Denmark and Norway** lead in consumption with over **200 kg per capita annually**, far exceeding the European average of **119.4 kg**.
- **Imports dominate supply**: All five countries import more plastic products than they produce domestically.
- **Packaging** is the main culprit, accounting for **one-third** of all plastic waste.
- By **2050**, unrecycled plastic waste could reach **4.5 million tons annually** under business-as-usual scenarios.

## The Path Forward

The research evaluated **three recycling scenarios to 2050**, revealing both opportunities and challenges:

- **Enhanced Mechanical Recycling (R1)**:  
  Could meet **27%** of regional plastic demand but requires expanding current capacity **6.7 times** by 2050.

- **Chemical Recycling without Pyrolysis (R2)**:  
  Could only satisfy **5%** of demand, with potential limited by the region's minimal production capacity for key polymers like **PET** and **polyester fibers**.

- **Chemical Recycling with Steam Cracking (R3)**:  
  Offers the greatest potential at **22%** of regional demand, and would reduce unrecycled waste to just **21%** of BAU levels.  
  However, current pilot capacity of **16,000 tons/year** is far below requirements.

## Implications

The study highlights that **international cooperation is essential** for Nordic countries to achieve their circular economy goals, particularly for chemical recycling where **local industrial capacity is limited**.

> “As one of the world's most developed and environmentally conscious regions, the Nordic experience provides critical insights for other regions working to improve plastic waste management,” notes the research team.

The findings were supported by multiple funding sources including the **EU TREASoURcE project**, **THRU and Climate-Compatible Packaging initiatives**, and **China's National Natural Science Foundation**.
