A groundbreaking study involving researchers from the **RISE team at Peking University** and **SMILE Lab from SDU** reveals the hidden vulnerabilities in the **global lithium supply chain network**, a critical component for achieving **carbon neutrality goals**. The research, published in *Environmental Science & Technology*, demonstrates how highly interconnected supply chains exhibit a **"robust yet fragile" paradox**—resilient to random shocks but vulnerable to targeted disruptions.

## The Lithium Challenge
Lithium is essential for **electric vehicle batteries** and the **global energy transition**. However, the **geographical mismatch** between production and consumption regions, combined with **highly concentrated supply sources** and **complex global trade networks**, exposes the supply chain to unprecedented risks:

- Trade restrictions  
- Resource nationalism  
- Natural disasters  
- Geopolitical conflicts

## Innovative Methodology

The research breaks new ground by combining:

- **Trade-linked material flow analysis**
- **Multi-layer network modeling**

This created a comprehensive map of the global lithium supply chain across **six life cycle stages**:

1. Ore  
2. Basic chemicals  
3. Chemical derivatives  
4. Final products  
5. Use  
6. Recycling

The team extended traditional static network metrics (e.g. **degree centrality**, **closeness centrality**, **betweenness centrality**, **eigenvector centrality**, **PageRank**, and **Laplacian centrality**) to multi-layer networks, and adapted **dynamic cascading failure models** to directed, weighted multi-layer networks.

## Key Findings

### Highly Interconnected but Geographically Concentrated

In **2022**, the lithium supply chain multi-layer network comprised:

- **865 nodes** across **225 countries** and **6 life cycle stages**
- **14,362 intra-layer links** (trade relationships)
- **634 inter-layer links** (production, processing, and consumption relationships)

Critical statistics include:

- **45%** of global lithium ore (**83 kt** out of **183 kt**) enters international trade, with **Australia-to-China** flows dominating at **79 kt**
- **55%** of basic lithium chemicals (**119 kt** out of **218 kt**) are traded internationally  
  - Major exporters: **Chile, Argentina, Netherlands, China**  
  - Major importers: **South Korea, Japan, US**
- **China** exports approximately **30 kt** of chemical derivatives and **10 kt** of final products

Key players: **Australia, China, Chile, Japan, South Korea, US, EU** — creating both **efficiency** and **vulnerability**.

### "Robust Yet Fragile" Network Characteristics

The study identified different node types based on their roles in **risk propagation**:

- **Risk Propagation Hubs** (high degree centrality): Absorb random shocks but amplify targeted disruptions
- **Risk Amplifiers** (high closeness centrality): Spread local disturbances via shortest paths
- **Risk Bridges** (high betweenness centrality): Connect suppliers and consumers; disruption can fragment the network
- **Network Stabilizers** (high Laplacian centrality): Maintain overall connectivity
- **Influential Risk Propagators** (high eigenvector/PageRank): Highly connected with significant destructive potential

## China-US Decoupling Scenarios

The study simulated various degrees of **China-US supply chain decoupling**, revealing systemic implications:

- **Direct Impact**:  
  China-US lithium trade = only **3%** of global trade volume → even **100% decoupling** does **not** improve US systemic risk position.

- **Indirect Impact**:  
  Cascading effects are substantial:

  - In **100% decoupling** scenarios:  
    - **61 countries** see increased dynamic criticality (**7%** of global total)  
    - **73 countries** experience increased dynamic vulnerability (**7%** increase)
  - **Germany, Poland, Hungary** gain criticality at the expense of **India, Vietnam, Australia**
  - **Chile, India, Canada** reduce vulnerability; **Malawi, Mexico, Slovakia, Ukraine** increase
  - Most decoupling scenarios (**50–100%**) increase global systemic risk by ~**5%**
  - However, **25% decoupling** could reduce global dynamic vulnerability by **8.26%**, with only marginal increase in criticality → suggesting **partial decoupling** may balance efficiency and security

## Policy Implications

The research calls for **global cooperation** to avoid **"zero-sum games"** in securing lithium supply chains. As geopolitical tensions intensify and supply chains shift from **global integration** toward **diversified confrontation**, policymakers must:

- Move beyond simple diversification
- Optimize **network topology** to balance **efficiency** and **security**

Countries with high vulnerability need:

- **Internal optimization** to improve self-sufficiency
- **External cooperation** to integrate domestic industries into regional/global supply chains  
→ Enhancing **competitive position** and **bargaining power**
