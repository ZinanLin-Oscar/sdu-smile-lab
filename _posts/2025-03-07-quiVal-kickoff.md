The QuiVal MSCA Doctoral Network officially launched with a workshop hosted by TU Delft, bringing together 13 PhD candidates and academic staff from partner universities across Europe.

The event introduced the program’s interdisciplinary approach to circular economy in real estate, with sessions led by faculty and industry partners. PhD candidates also presented their research topics and began planning their collaborative work for the coming years.

We look forward to the exciting research and innovation ahead.
